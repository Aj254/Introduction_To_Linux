Get familiar with the terminal and the basic commands

Introduction

The aim of this first assignment is to get more familiar with the basic terminal commands that we've already gone over. The best way to learn Linux and get more comfortable with it to practice and force yourself to start using it.

Tools used in this session

If you do have a Linux system installed in your machine, make use of your system terminal. If you are a windows user, we highly recommend the use of the Cywgin tool (https://cygwin.com/index.html). You can find more information about the Cywgin installation via this link: https://cygwin.com/install.html


Filenames under Linux

•	Make sure you separate your command name, arguments and options using spaces
•	Each option is preceded by - (examples: -l, -r, -lh)
•	Linux is case-sensitive: A and a are different

Online emulators

There are online free terminal emulators could be used to start learning how to work under Linux and the very basic commands but you will not be able to deal with your real big data files like BAM files, big genomes Fasta files, GFF annotations files, etc.

A main advantage of Webminal and the command line bootcamp is the fact that they provide tutorials that teach you how to work with the command-line.
Using these online tools will help you to get ready to start dealing with your data using the commands lines and the Linux terminal.
